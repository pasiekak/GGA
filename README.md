`Note #1`: You may see some warnings during dependency installation. It's because of `ml5` library uses some old and deprecated libraries

`Note #2`: This project is written using `TypeScript` but `ml5` doesn't provide support for this language so last task is created using `Typescript` combined with pure `JavaScript`.

Have fun!
